Selective Memory


If I lay my head down
I will see you in my dream
Wearing that polka dot dress
And sitting by the stream
Leaning in to hear you
You will whisper in my ear
And everything I need to know
I finally hear

I wish I could remember
But my selective memory
Won't let me

When I was a baby we would


To out to the park
And sit out in the fountain
And splash around until it's dark
Days go on forever
When you only know that much
And everything you need to know
Is answered with one touch

I wish I could remember
But my selective memory
Won't let me
